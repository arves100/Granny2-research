Repo deprecated! See [opengr2](https://github.com/arves100/opengr2)

Attempts at decoding the Granny2 file format.

A documentation of what is known about the format can be shown [in this wiki page](https://github.com/arves100/gr2decode/wiki/File-Format-Documentation).

## Contributing
You are allowed to comtribute with new info about the file format or compressions.

The goal of the project is to make an open source parser that can correctly load Skeletal Animations.
